; Server reconnect interval (in seconds); how often to retry
; Connecting to an asterisk server whose connection was lost
retryinterval = 2

; Number of times to retry connecting to a given server
; use 0 for infinitely, or some finite number
maxretries = 10

; How long do we wait on the manager port for an SSL session start? (ms)
sslclienthellotimeout = 200

; Do we accept encrypted SSL manager connections?
acceptencryptedconnection = yes

; Do we accept unencrypted manager connections?
acceptunencryptedconnection = yes

; Amount of time to wait before timing out on writes to asterisk
asteriskwritetimeout=100

; Amount of time to wait before timing out on writes to clients

; Our server-side SSL certificate; what we use when answering clients
certfile = /var/lib/asterisk/certs/proxy-server.pem

; Address for proxy to listen on, can be set to * or x.x.x.x format
; recommend that you listen only on 127.0.0.1 or on an interface that
; is otherwise locked down to a trusted host, since the proxy
; currently provides NO authentication/authorization of its own
listenaddress = *

; Port for proxy to listen on		
listenport = 1234

; Do we require authentication (either proxykey or astmanproxy.users entry)?
; See README and astmanproxy.users for more info
authrequired = no

; Setting a proxy key requires proxy client connections to
; specify a ProxyKey: keyvalue header in the first incoming request
; to the proxy.  Once this is done the client remains authenticated.
; This allows for a simple security layer.  If not specified,
; no key is required, however other security measures (listening on
; a protected interface, behind firewall, iptables, etc) should be
; in place and well understood.
; proxykey = foobar

; local user and group for proxy to run as; will NOT run as root!

; default input and output format for clients
; inputformat = (standard|xml|http)
; outputformat = (standard|xml|csv)

; to enable REST/XMLRPC-like functionality, try this combo.
; this gives you http input (POST or GET) and either
; text/xml or text/plain output with NO webserver required!
; to access: http://[host]:1234/?Action=Ping&ActionID=Foo
;
; inputformat = http
; outputfomat = xml|standard
; autofilter = on

; set autofilter to be 'on' or 'off' by default
; with autofilter 'on', you can automatically filter responses
; to include only messages related to a specific actionid,
; as specified in a previous message
; 'unique' is an enhanced mechanism for this but does not pass
; exactly the same ActionID through to Asterisk
; valid values: on, off, unique
; can also be changed on a per-client basis using
; ProxyAction: SetAutoFilter
; AutoFilter: (on|off|unique)
autofilter = off

; set filterlocal to allow dialling using Channel: Local/xxx
; where it would normally be filtered.
; 'off' filters all Local/ calls as normal
; 'allow' allows all Local/ originate: calls
; 'allowwith' allows Local/ originate: calls sent as Local/xxx@ocontext
; 'enforce' will ensure that the channel is sent as Local/xxx@ocontext
; valid values: off, allow, allowwith, enforce
filterlocal = off

; location of logfile -- will be owned by proc_user/proc_group
