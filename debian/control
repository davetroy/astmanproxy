Description: Proxy daemon for Asterisk Manager Protocol
 Proxy daemon for Asterisk Manager Protocol. Its primary purpose is
 to offload the use of many threads to handle multiple AMP connections
 into a far more lightweight external daemon to improve stability and
 scaleability. It also adds authentication, filtering, and multi-server
 support.
